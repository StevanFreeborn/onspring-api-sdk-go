# Onspring API Go SDK

⚠️ Under Construction ⚠️

The Go SDK for the Onspring API is meant to simplify development in Go for Onspring customers who want to build integrations with their Onspring instance.

Note: This is an unofficial SDK for the Onspring API. It was not built in consultation with Onspring Technologies LLC or a member of their development team.

This SDK was developed independently using Onspring's existing C# SDK, the Onspring API's swagger page, and api documentation as the starting point with the intention of making development of integrations done in Javascript with an Onspring instance quicker and more convenient.
